This repository is for presentations composed in R Markdown then rendered. These slideshows embed analytics to minimize human error and better demon

Current Presentations in this Repository:

1. *template* -- shows basic structure, tables and plots in R Presentation

####How to Create a Report

* Copy the `template` folder and rename it to something new.

* Rename `template.md` and `template.Rpres` to match the name of your new folder and start writing your presentation!

####Presenting Your Results

This can be accomplished via 2 vehicles (.html and .pdf), both which RStudio allows you to point-and-click to create.

1. .html
	1. In the "Presentation" tab in the top right quadrant of RStudio, you will see a gear wheel titled "More". Click on it.
	2. Then click "Save as Web Page...". 
2. .pdf
	1. In the project's folder there should be a .md file (e.g. template.md)
	3. Open the .md file in RStudio
	4. There is a dropdown menu in the top left quadrant of RStudio that says "Preview HTML". Click on it and select "Preview in PDF". 
	5. This will generate a PDF version of your slides.
